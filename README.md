# Intelligent Mobile Scheduling & Tracking Application

This is the suggested Application Proposal for the Software Engineering coursework of Group 21. I lead my group of 7 as the Scrum Master in designing a Mental Health Application to assist students in their university life by largely automating daily schedules around uni life. This aims to reduce their stress, increase their productivity and overall improve their mental health.

## The general task

"In collaboration with the Architecture, Security and Innovation Unit of the University IT Services, we are seeking innovative suggestions for interactive applications of your choice that aim at tackling mental health and/or raising awareness about mental health. The scope is open and can relate to any of the mental health issues that your group is interested to investigate and design a software solution for. Among the many mental health issues include but not limited to depression, low self-esteem, anxiety and panic attacks, sleep disorder, addiction, suicidal thoughts, mood fluctuation etc. Your application may target one or more audience (e.g. mental health in children, school pupils, University students, ageing population, addicts, homeless etc.). You software solution has to deal with one chosen issue of interest (e.g., an app to manage depression; a virtual reality environment for positive thinking; a hologram boot for confidential counselling; an intelligent app for predicting mood fluctuation etc). Your software solution may also aim at educating and engaging with the concerned individuals and/or public. Your application may wish to use AI, Big data and/or emerging technologies (e.g., virtual and augmented reality, gesture controlled interactions, holograms, and/or mobile apps among the others- as seen fit) for your chosen system. Please note that the University has been investing in Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (see that the Collaborative engineering lab) and you may wish to feature these in your solution. We are open for creative, novel ideas and useful applications of societal change and positive health impact. We hope that your innovative solution will help us showcase the University of Birmingham as a cutting-edge institution in the use of data science and emerging technologies. We also hope to demonstrate the creativity and ability of our software engineering students to conceptualise innovative digital solutions and to demonstrate their technical skills in systematically engineering data science solutions, covering requirements, distributed architecture and design."
